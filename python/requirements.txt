# The orginal work was developed upon tensorflow-gpu==1.8
# However this machine is equiped with libcuda.10.1 and 
# tensorlfow-gpu==1.8 always seeks for libcuda.9.0. We also
# have some problems to use tensorflow 2.0 because many operators
# are no longer valid. Finally we just update our codes to use 
# tensorflow 2.0 with 1.x compatible interface.
